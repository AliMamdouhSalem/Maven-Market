# Data
The data set consists of the following CSV files:

- Calendar
- Customers
- Products
- Regions
- Returns 1997-1998
- Stores
- Transactions 1997
- Transactions 1998

# Transformation
Several Cleaning and transformation steps were done using Power Query Editor like:

- Used the Power Query Editor to expand on the date column in calendar lookup to create several date columns like start of week, start of month, start of quarter, start of year and many more.
- Promoting headers and changing types
- Created a full name column combining the first name and last name columns in the customer dimension table
- Created a date key in several table by turning the date column into text and then removing the '/'
- Appended the two Transactions CSVs into one table

Those are only examples, please check the report file to see all the transformations, calculated columns, and measures that were done.

# Model 
Used Dimensional modelling techniques to model the data into two facts 

- Sales Fact
- Returns Fact
  
All the other tables were dimensions for these 2 facts.
